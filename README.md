A Markdown editor with ability to export it to multiple formats preserving its styling

> Providing with the great UI and completely open source.

Made by [Rahuletto](https://marban.is-a.dev) with [Remirror](https://remirror.io/docs/showcase/markdown). Inspired by [md2pdf](https://github.com/realdennis/md2pdf)

Made as a joke
> My university gave assignments to write programs but rather use MSWord to send them instead of paste bins. As everyone knows MSWord with codes suck. So i made a Markdown editor so i can export it as PDF and submit instead.
